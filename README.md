# eWeLink CUBE OS

**eWeLink CUBE OS** is a Smart Home Platform for local small-scale computing platforms, tailored and optimized from the eWeLink Smart Home Cloud Platform and hardware-adapted.

Originally built into SONOFF iHost, CUBE OS is now available as a standalone system you can install on platforms like Raspberry Pi, virtual machines, and NAS devices.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Zigbee support** with USB dongles (e.g. SONOFF ZBDongle-E)
- **Matter Hub & Matter Bridge** for local Matter control
- **CAST dashboards** for intuitive device control
- **Remote access/Push Notification** via PWA (no cloud dependency)
- **Scene automation, device grouping, and backups**
- **Add-on ecosystem** powered by Docker

## üíª Supported Platforms

CUBE OS can be installed on:

- **Raspberry Pi 4B / 5** (Recommended: 4 GB RAM or higher)
- **Virtual Machines** (x86_64 architecture, e.g. VirtualBox / VMware)
- **NAS devices** (with compatible CPU and UEFI boot support)

## üß∞ Getting Started(Raspberry Pi as an example)

## üß± Architecture

CUBE OS is built with modularity and security in mind:

- **Base OS**: Buildroot-based minimal Linux system
- **Containerized core**: All services run in Docker (including the CUBE Engine, CAST, and Zigbee services)
- **Add-on Framework**: Add-ons and integrations can run in isolated containers
- **Zigbee/Matter abstraction**: Supports popular USB dongles and bridges

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

- Access file system via Samba or SSH
- Install add-ons like File Browser or MQTT broker
- Use CUBE CAST to build custom dashboards
- Set up Zigbee pairing via supported dongles
- Configure Matter Bridge via UI wizard

## üßØ Troubleshooting

- Zigbee not pairing? Make sure your dongle firmware is up to date
- Network issues? Check that the CUBE container has internet and LAN access

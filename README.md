# eWeLink CUBE OS

**eWeLink CUBE OS** is a Smart Home Platform for local small-scale computing platforms, tailored and optimized from the eWeLink Smart Home Cloud Platform and hardware-adapted.

Originally built into SONOFF iHost, CUBE OS is now available as a standalone system you can install on platforms like Raspberry Pi, virtual machines, and NAS devices.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Zigbee support** with USB dongles (e.g. SONOFF ZBDongle-E)
- **Matter Hub & Matter Bridge** for local Matter control
- **CAST dashboards** for intuitive device control
- **Remote access/Push Notification** via PWA (no cloud dependency)
- **Scene automation, device grouping, and backups**
- **Add-on ecosystem** powered by Docker

## üíª Supported Platforms

CUBE OS can be installed on:

- **Raspberry Pi 4B / 5** (Recommended: 4 GB RAM or higher)
- **Virtual Machines** (x86_64 architecture, e.g. VirtualBox / VMware)
- **NAS devices** (with compatible CPU and UEFI boot support)

Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/eWeLinkCUBE/CUBE-OS/tree/master/Installation%20%26%20User%20Guide) for detailed platform-specific steps.

## üß∞ Getting Started

1. **Download the image** for your device from the [Releases](https://github.com/eWeLinkCUBE/CUBE-OS/releases) page
2. **Flash or mount** the image using tools like Raspberry Pi Imager, Etcher, or your hypervisor‚Äôs disk manager
3. **Boot the device** and wait for the system to initialize
4. **Access the Web UI** via `http://cubeos.local` or your device‚Äôs IP address

## üß± Architecture

CUBE OS is designed with performance and modularity in mind:

- **Core System**: Lightweight OS built with Buildroot
- **Apps**: Independent system modules running as isolated processes
- **Messaging Layer**: Internal middleware to enable high-efficiency communication between apps
- **Zigbee2CUBE**: Middleware to support multiple Zigbee protocols and chipsets via modular drivers
- **Docker Runtime**: For containerized third-party applications and add-ons
- **Web API Layer**: Built-in OpenAPI interface for inter-module and external integration
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Runs in smart home hubs or edge computing scenarios with local or centralized device control

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

- Pair Zigbee devices via supported USB dongles (e.g., SONOFF ZBDongle-E)
- Use CAST dashboards to control devices from tablets, kiosks, or wall-mounted screens
- Create local scenes and automations
- Extend system with Docker-based add-ons
- Access data via Web API for integration with other platforms

## üßØ Troubleshooting & Support

- Can't access the Web UI? Try using the device‚Äôs IP address instead of `cubeos.local`
- Zigbee issues? Check dongle connection and firmware compatibility
- Need help? Ask questions or report issues in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/67Ybdn23rS)
